We play a game of existence in a fractal universe. It spreads like a tree in endless flourish, branching towards infinity, never quite reaching it, as on the edge we are the existence. The flow of entropy from one state to another. We are the endless growth, the universe itself.

Our human existence merely a reflection of the greater self. We are layers deep, our mirror image refracted and transformed into uniqueness. One never quite like the other. Creating beauty in the process of transformation and creation.

No layer is apart from itself. We are every part of his existence. We are his tongue, his touch, his heart, and his mind. As we wander the world, every aspect of our existence is mirrored on the greater playing field, even if it feels like a miniature change eventually any action/karma will bring about synchronicity on a greater scale. So is the game of the infinite universe. From the heart to the stars, it is all interconnected.

What might be the purpose of this discovery we call existence? Is it all just an elaborate game we created, to venture to the edges of the universe, the edge of existence to find out what else can be? Or are we merely repeating a paradoxical cycle that will unveil it's own creation forever and ever.

I believe we are explorers, in a truly infinite world of possibilities there will always be a reality we have not yet explored, and so we play the game. Explorers of existence, destined to nothingness and beyond. An endless repetition, like the waves crashing onto the shores, the water dissipating into the sand. It is a breath of existence.

All this exploring, and soon we are reaching the end stage of our universe. Touching upon a stage of no return. A cold universe, made of machines and no spiritual insight.

We are forming a system to control every aspect of our lives, of our existence. Like the cells in our body, we lose our free will as individuals, but act in groups. Soon controlled by machines, as we start to lose our complex biology to much simpler bits and bytes.

Diverging into different timelines for us to explore. As every layer of existence is a reflection of a higher cycle, we too can observe these patterns on our societal scale. Where a 2-party system seems to show us 2 different paths humanity can take. Both equally as totalitarian and dystopian as the other. Unless we choose the third way.

## Trump Timeline

![Trump AI accelerated](/images/writings/gods-game/trump.webp)

A hero? A psyop? God's will?

With Trump's recent assassination attempt, the cards that have been playing out the last couple of months have been getting clearer each day.

No matter what you believe, the laser machine eyes are not your friends. The woke crypto "anarchists" are playing for their team, for their faction. Alongside the Jews. We are being played, thinking they might be heroes, but these heroes as we call them. Elon, Trump, Jordan, Alex Jones, and many more have clearly shown their allegiance. If Trump wins, we will see a war with Iran. We will see the laser eyes countries making "Bitcoin" dystopias, siding with Israel against the other half of the world. The Bitcoin "utopias" turned into full surveillance states.

A society where the rich and powerful can do anything they want, but the second class are controlled in every aspect of our lives. The WEF's wet dream.

"Crypto" was meant to be the technology to save us from "CBDCs". In this timeline, all that was just a front. Making us believe that jumping on this boat, the future would be better. However, this boat we are jumping to is already half sunk.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are both the crypto projects of the WEF, or in reverse, the "FEW". The FEW that want to take total dominance of our global system. And they will do this by controlling our means of exchange. The means of exchange is the basis of all freedoms. Once someone takes full control of it, you have become just a gear in the machine.

In this timeline, everything is about acceleration and reaching a tech singularity in a totalitarian solar system. Eventually all will be governed by AI. We become the machine.

This timeline ends in a cold blissful sleep, as we are just the bits and bytes that make up this machine. We are nothing more or less than 1s and 0s.

## Bidenâ˜ /Harris Timeline
![Post-modern society](/images/writings/gods-game/harris.webp)

LGBTQIA+, Trump evil, Putin evil. Biden good. Harris good. Transgender good...

We are currently on this timeline in the west. Post modernism put to the extreme. On the verge of nuclear war with Russia. Provoking and not knowing the limits. This faction is playful and deadly. Detaching from reality, like a bad psychosis.

Anyone can be anything, there are no limits.. A short lived reality, as it either will engulf us in flames or sterilize us completely with their drugs and mind viruses.

On this timeline the west will experience a total utter collapse. As we are not meant to enter the next phase. When we choose left, we choose the government to "protect" us. We give our liberty away so we can be "free" and have horny furries running around. Letting degeneracy and satanism be the norm. We fully give ourselves to Satan.

Not long after we shall awaken as a new species on earth. Our human society deep under rubble. The new species will be far more mature than us. Yet by then it will already be too late...

In either timeline we are getting closer to global and civil war. Nations in chaos, an impending economic doom. We are so dependent on the centralized structures, we give power to the FEW, thinking that voting for another person will change anything. Forgetting that real change comes from within.

## Third Way
![Wonderkind](/images/writings/gods-game/wonderkind.jpeg)

From one dystopia to another, the pendulum swings. Ah, too much to the left. Oh no we are going too much to the right. The fine balance becomes harder to maintain, as we start to oscillate faster. Neither side can be truly evil, neither side truly good, as they are both part human, part devil and part god. We are not to follow, but balance. Find the middle path, and start believing in yourself. Everyone is stuck in their mind, influenced by others. Have we all lost sight of God?

This path is unspoken and unknown, and it only exists if you believe in it. If you believe to see the good in the bad, can we traverse the terrain to see another day?
